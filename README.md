# Website for Organizing My Book Club
I created a quick website that allows members of my bookclub to know whose turn it is to speak during our discussion time. 

## Accessing the Website
I decided to host the site using Netlify, so my book club members can more easily access the site. You can access the site here: https://creative-sorbet-ada41e.netlify.app/ 

## Future Improvements
Below are a couple of improvements I'd like to make to this project:
* Friendly URL: I'd like to buy a domain name so that it is easier for my book club members to remember the URL needed to access this site
* Improved Logic: I'd like to prevent the case in which a user clicks shuffle and the list does not shuffle because the program randomly picked the same order that it was currently in.
